- ⚡ Fun fact -  there’s a tiny jellyfish — Turritopsis dohrnii — that can literally hit the reset button on its life. When it gets stressed or injured, it shrinks back into its baby form and starts growing all over again. In theory, it never has to die of old age.
- 👀 I’m interested in bodybuilding, programming, and gaming. I want to make my own ML models, AI agents, games and apps.
